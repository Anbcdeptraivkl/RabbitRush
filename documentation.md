# TIMING

# Background
- Wait for Spawning before Scrolling
- Scroll at the same speed as the Entities moving (Illusion of Running on still ground)
- Stop on Game Over

# BALANCING

## SPawn Balance
- Spawn Numbers, Time between Waves and Time between Collectibles - Obstacles are all Random between a Range for Refreshing Runs everytime
- Spawn Faster every 20 waves
- No Patterns should be spawned more than 3 times in a row
- Pauses and Breaks between Waves of Obstacles and Collectibles
- Consecutive Collectibles Pattern waves  for every 5 - 10 Obstacle Waves Passed, otherwise Spawned Randomly as usual

# HARD STATS

- Entities SPeed: 10
- Background Scrolling SPeed (Offset): 0.55
